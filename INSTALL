It is currently rather complicated to install uxpanel. However, this document will guide you through the installation.

******************
*** Extraction ***
******************

First, download uxpanel and extract if necessary.
Copy all files to somewhere in your web root.

In this guide, we will assume you have installed uxpanel to http://example.com/uxpanel/ in /var/www/uxpanel/.

*********************
*** Configuration ***
*********************

Now, fill in the local configuration information. First:
	cd /var/www/uxpanel && cp config_default.php config_local.php

Go through config_local.php and fill in the options. In particular, set site_name, ghost_path (shouldn't exist yet), ghost_password (set to random string), channel_path (shouldn't exist yet), mail_from, admin_password, and the database configuration.

**********************
*** Database setup ***
**********************

First, create the database. The database name is the db_name configuration option; we will use "uxpanel" for the name, along with the username and password:
	CREATE DATABASE uxpanel;
	GRANT ALL ON uxpanel.* TO 'uxpanel'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'uxpanel';
	source /var/www/uxpanel/install.sql

This will create all the needed tables and such.

*******************************
*** Directory configuration ***
*******************************

Now, we will set up some directories. These directories will hold the files that will be shared across all services. When (/if) you create a new service through uxpanel, it will base the new service on the files in these directories. This applies to all three types of services (GHost, pychop, database).

*************************************
*** Ghost directory configuration ***
*************************************

Create the ghost_path that you set earlier in configuration. We will use /home/uxpanel/ghost/:
	mkdir /home/uxpanel/ghost/
	cd /home/uxpanel/ghost/

Several files are required by uxpanel that must be created manually depending on how you want your panel set up. These are:
	- ghost++: the GHost executable file
	- install.sql: the database definitions needed to create a GHost database (only CREATE TABLE statements)
	- language.cfg: the default language configuration to use

In addition, a maps/ directory should exist (/home/uxpanel/ghost/maps/). This will be used for the public map repository feature of uxpanel. This directory can be empty.

The web user will need access to the ghost directory:
	chown -R www-data:www-data /home/uxpanel/ghost/

***************************************
*** Channel directory configuration ***
***************************************

The channel directory structure is similar, except these files are needed instead:
	- chop++: the pychop executable file
	- language.cfg: the default language configuration to use
	- plugins/: a directory containing all of the plugins to use
	- cfg/: a directory containing default cfg/ pychop configuration files (not including the main chop.cfg configuration file though)

*****************************************
*** Minecraft directory configuration ***
*****************************************

mkdir /home/uxpanel/minecraft/
cd /home/uxpanel/minecraft/

Add the following files:
	- minecraft.jar: the default server version
	- versions/: directory containing different server versions (including default)
	- plugins/: directory containing plugins repository (users can symlink to this)

To enable user to upload plugins and server versions, add a service parameter with key "uploadable" and value "1" (actually any value works). You should only do this if you're using the jail feature and have properly set user resource limits and filesystem permissions.

********************
*** Finishing up ***
********************

Now, the uxpanel installation is complete. Use /check.php to check your configuration for problems.
